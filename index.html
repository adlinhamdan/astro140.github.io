        <p><b>Welcome to our journey through the cosmos, where we explore the fascinating realm of exoplanets. But first, what exactly is an exoplanet?</b></p>
        
        <p>An exoplanet, short for "extrasolar planet," is a planet that orbits a star outside our solar system. These distant worlds come in all shapes, sizes, and compositions, and their discovery has revolutionized our understanding of the universe.</p>
        
        <p><b>Why are Exoplanets Important?</b></p>
        
        <p>The discovery of exoplanets has profound implications for our understanding of planetary systems and the possibilities of life beyond our own solar system. For centuries, astronomers speculated about the existence of planets around other stars, but it wasn't until the 1990s that technology and observational techniques advanced enough to confirm their existence.</p>
        
        <p><b>Diversity of Exoplanets</b></p>
        
        <p>Exoplanets vary widely in their characteristics. Some are giant gas planets similar to Jupiter, while others are rocky, Earth-like worlds. They orbit their host stars at various distances, some so close that their surfaces are scorching hot, while others are located within the habitable zone where conditions could support liquid water and, potentially, life as we know it.</p>
