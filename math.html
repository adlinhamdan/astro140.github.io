        <h3>Important Steps in Calculating Exoplanet</h3>

        <h4>1. Phase Folding: Determining Exoplanet Periods</h4>    

        <img src="phase.jpg" alt="Adeline" width="550" height="300">

        <p>Phase folding is a technique used to determine the period of an exoplanet's orbit from its transit data. It provides a powerful method to analyze exoplanet data, helping astronomers understand the characteristics of exoplanetary systems.</p>

        <div class="measurement">
            <h3>Observation</h3>
            <p>Astronomers observe the star's brightness over time.</p>
            
            <h3>Identifying Transits</h3>
            <p>They identify dips in brightness caused by exoplanet transits.</p>
            
            <h3>Phase Folding</h3>
            <p>Transits are aligned based on their phases, creating a 'folded' light curve.</p>
            
            <h3>Period Determination</h3>
            <p>The folded light curve reveals the periodicity of the transits, indicating the orbital period of the exoplanet.</p>
            <p>Formula: \( P^2 = \frac{{4\pi^2}}{{G(M+m)}}a^3 \)</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( P \) is the orbital period,</li>
                <li>\( G \) is the gravitational constant,</li>
                <li>\( M \) is the mass of the star,</li>
                <li>\( m \) is the mass of the exoplanet, and</li>
                <li>\( a \) is the semi-major axis.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Deriving Orbital Properties</h3>
            <p>From the period, other orbital properties like semi-major axis and eccentricity can be derived.</p>

        <h4>2. Radial Velocity Method: How We Learn About Exoplanets</h4>

        <img src="rv.jpg" alt="Adeline" width="550" height="300">
    
        <p>When a star has planets orbiting around it, it doesn't stay completely still. Instead, it wobbles slightly because of the gravitational pull of its planets. This wobble makes the star move a bit towards us and then away from us in a repeating pattern.</p>
        
        <h3>Here's how we use this to learn about exoplanets:</h3>
        
        <h3>Detecting the Wobble:</h3>
        <p>We measure this movement of the star using a method called radial velocity. As the star moves towards us, its light looks a bit bluer, and as it moves away, it looks a bit redder. By seeing how these colors change, we can tell if the star is moving closer or farther away from us.</p>
        
        <h3>Learning About the Planet:</h3>
        <p>When we see this repeating movement in the star's motion, we know there's likely a planet causing it. The size of the wobble tells us about the planet's mass. A bigger wobble means a heavier planet.</p>
        
        <h3>Finding the Orbit:</h3>
        <p>The time it takes for the star to complete one wobble tells us how long it takes the planet to orbit its star once. This is called the orbital period.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding the Orbit Shape:</h3>
        <p>The shape of the wobble can tell us if the planet's orbit is stretched out or more circular. This is called the orbital eccentricity.</p>
        
        <p>By looking at these wobbles in the star's movement, we can figure out a lot about the planets around it, like how big they are, how long they take to orbit their star, and what their orbits look like.</p>

        <h4>3. Light Transit Curve: How We Learn More</h4>

        <img src="transit.jpg" alt="Adeline" width="550" height="300">
    
        <p>The light transit curve is a method used by astronomers to study exoplanets. When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star from our perspective (an event called a transit), it blocks a small fraction of the star's light, causing a detectable decrease in brightness. This dimming effect is temporary and periodic, occurring each time the exoplanet completes an orbit around its star.</p>

        <h3>Here's how astronomers use the light transit curve:</h3>

        <h3>1. Detecting Transits:</h3>
        <p>Astronomers continuously monitor the brightness of stars. When they observe a periodic dip in a star's brightness, it suggests that a planet is transiting in front of it.</p>

        <h3>2. Creating the Light Transit Curve:</h3>
        <p>By measuring the changes in brightness over time during these transits, astronomers create a graph called a light transit curve. This curve shows the relative brightness of the star as the planet crosses in front of it.</p>

        <h3>3. Extracting Information:</h3>
        <p>The shape and duration of the dip in brightness provide important information about the exoplanet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Size of the Exoplanet:</strong> The depth of the dip in brightness indicates the size of the exoplanet relative to its host star. Larger dips suggest larger planets.</li>
            <li><strong>Orbital Period:</strong> The time between each dip in brightness corresponds to the orbital period of the exoplanet. This helps astronomers determine how long it takes for the planet to complete one orbit around its star.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Formula Used</h3>
        <div class="formula">
            <h3>Transit Depth (\( \Delta F \))</h3>
            <p>\( \Delta F = \left( \frac{{R_p}}{{R^*}} \right)^2 \)</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( \Delta F \): Transit depth (fractional decrease in brightness).</li>
                <li>\( R_p \): Radius of the planet.</li>
                <li>\( R^* \): Radius of the star.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="formula">
            <h3>Transit Duration (\( T \))</h3>
            <p>\( T â‰ˆ \frac{{P}}{{\pi}} \times \arcsin\left( \frac{{R^*}}{{a}} \right) \)</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( T \): Transit duration.</li>
                <li>\( P \): Orbital period of the planet.</li>
                <li>\( R^* \): Radius of the star.</li>
                <li>\( a \): Semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="formula">
            <h3>Planetary Radius (\( R_p \))</h3>
            <p>\( R_p = R^* \times \sqrt{\Delta F} \)</p>
            <p>Where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( R_p \): Radius of the planet.</li>
                <li>\( R^* \): Radius of the star.</li>
                <li>\( \Delta F \): Transit depth.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

    <h3>Equilibrium Temperature Formula</h3>
    <p>The formula for calculating the equilibrium temperature (\( T_{\text{eq}} \)) of a planet is:</p>
    <p>\[ T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \left( \frac{{R_{\text{star}}}}{{4a}} \right)^{1/4} \]</p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( T_{\text{star}} \): Temperature of the star (in Kelvin)</li>

    </ul>

    <p>\[ \bar{\rho} = \frac{M}{V} = \frac{M}{\left( \frac{4}{3} \right) \pi R^3} \]</p>

    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>\( \bar{\rho} \): Mean density of the planet</li>
        <li>\( M \): Mass of the planet</li>
        <li>\( R \): Radius of the planet</li>
    </ul>
