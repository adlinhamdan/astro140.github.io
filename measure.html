        <h3>Understanding Our Exoplanet: Key Measurements</h3>
        
        <p>Welcome to our exploration of the quantitative measurements of our exoplanet. In this section, we will examine crucial scientific data that sheds light on the nature of our celestial discovery.</p>
        
        <h3>What Kind of Information Can We Get from an Exoplanet?</h3>
        
        <p>In this section, we will use the measurements of one of the exoplanets as an example, including its mass, radius, density, equilibrium temperature, and orbit properties, to illustrate how scientists analyze data to understand the characteristics of distant worlds.</p>
        
        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Mass: 1.45 \( M_{\text{jup}} \)</h4>
            <p>The mass of our exoplanet is measured at 1.45 Jupiter masses. This tells us how much material the planet contains. With a mass comparable to Jupiter's, our exoplanet is likely a gas giant, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium. However, this does not mean it will be similar to Jupiter if we only look at the mass. This will be explained as you read more below.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Radius: 0.949 \( R_{\text{jup}} \)</h4>
            <p>The radius of our exoplanet is approximately 0.95 times the radius of Jupiter. This indicates the size of the exoplanet. Despite its similar mass to Jupiter, our exoplanet is slightly smaller, suggesting it may be more dense or have a different composition.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Density: 2,104 kg/m<sup>3</sup></h4>
            <p>The density of our exoplanet is 2,104 kilograms per cubic meter. This is significantly denser than Jupiter, suggesting a composition that includes heavier elements such as water, rocks, and metals. The higher density implies a more compact and possibly rocky structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Equilibrium Temperature: 457.801K</h4>
            <p>The equilibrium temperature of our exoplanet is 457.8 Kelvin. This temperature represents the balance between the energy it receives from its host star and the energy it radiates into space. With a relatively high equilibrium temperature, our exoplanet may experience extreme heat, potentially making it unsuitable for life as we know it.</p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Orbit Properties</h3>
        
        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Period: 86.6476 days</h4>
            <p>The period of our exoplanet's orbit is approximately 86.6 days. This is the time it takes for the exoplanet to complete one orbit around its host star.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Semi-major Axis: 0.382 AU</h4>
            <p>The semi-major axis of our exoplanet's orbit is 0.382 astronomical units (AU). This represents the average distance between the exoplanet and its host star.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="measurement">
            <h4>Eccentricity: 0.73</h4>
            <p>The eccentricity of our exoplanet's orbit is 0.73. This value indicates the degree of elongation of the orbit. A high eccentricity suggests that the orbit is highly elongated, possibly leading to significant variations in temperature throughout the orbit.</p>
